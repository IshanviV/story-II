It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. 
It was a dark and stormy night
A dark and stormy night
When Roronoa Zoro
Took out his pen to write
A poem or a story that was ghastly, grim, and gory
On a dark, and stormy night.
Oh how the man loved his three swords,
Conversations in the dead of night with blades of steel.
When they screamed for blood, for killing, for battle,
He never failed to quench their thirst.
